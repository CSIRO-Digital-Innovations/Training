# CSIRO Digital Innovations Training 2022 <img align="right" src="resources/CSIRO.png">


### Overview

The goals of these training activities are outlines in the Digital Innovations team objectives for 2022/2023.

Task 4 â€“ Training for A&F Modelling and Software

**Background:** The development of improved software processes within CSIRO Agriculture and Food is the fourth strategic priority within our three-year plan.  The Digital Innovations team has an opportunity to share its skills with staff across the BU.  Furthermore, there is unretained value in software and data developed in projects.  The team will work with staff to ensure greater capture of value within good software processes to improve the sustainability of APSIM, and BU efforts more generally.

**Task objectives:**
1) To train key CSIRO staff in 
	* APSIM Next Generation
	* Processes for capturing value from CSIRO projects into APSIM, or software processes generally
	* New methods for model deployment developed by the team
	* Best practice software development processes for use with all digital product development
2) Develop stronger links between the software team and project staff across the BU
3) Greater capture of value from projects using APSIM or other digital products
4) Software engineering in A&F follows best practice to become more efficient, effective and sustainable.

**Task outputs:** 1) Training workshop in Brisbane, 2) Training workshop in Canberra

**Strategic Alignment:** Sustainable Business Model for Software Development AND Improved software processes within CSIRO Agriculture and Food
