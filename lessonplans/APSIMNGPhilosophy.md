### Getting the right mindset with APSIM Next Generation

#### Objective
Experienced APSIM users understand why APSIM Next Generation is different, and why they need to change their approaches

#### Background Knowledge
* working knowledge of APSIM NG or Classic
* Basic understanding of the APSIM Initiative and APSIM licencing


#### Materials/Setup
* APSIM Next Generation should be installed on participant's PC


#### Key Messages

###### Things are often different because we need to manage costs
* We stopped developing Classic because it became too expensive to maintain.
* Many things are different to Classic.  Reducing costs is driving a lot of this. (e.g. shortcuts looked simple but required a lot of code behind the scenes).

###### Classic talked the talk, but it no longer met our expectations WRT quality
* We asked people to provide test datasets, but many models had insufficent tests.
* We drew a line in the sand and started again.
* We have set the standard high again in APSIM Next Generation

###### Benefits of the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF)
* Plant models can be browsed within the UI and so model code is more transparent.
* Easier for non-programmers to contribute.

###### Change Happens, so plan for it
* Classic models where updated perhaps once a year.  Now it is more than once a day. 
* Regular change means that you get benefits of change immediately.  You just need to plan for it (and manage it).

###### Capture, Commit, Collaborate and Safeguard the Future of your Work
* Commit your changes and project files to APSIM version control.  
* Once in our tests, we will ensure that your work always runs as planned.

###### If it is not in version control, it doesn't exist.
* Follows on from previous point.
* We don't and cannot support stuff that is not in our systems.

###### Look Before You Leap - we may already have a tool that does what you need
* Models.exe (ie the code you run when you run APSIM) can do more than just run the model.
* The model can actually change parameters on the fly (ie you don't need to write code to change input files).
* Ask us before you start writing R or python code.  Our approach is to provide the core functionality within the model itself.

###### If You Need New Capability, Fund it and it will happen
* We can develop the model for you, or we can assist in mentoring/training your staff to be leaders in this field.
* Don't wait for us to build something for you.  
* We will prioritise the models that provide funding or have a clear contractual committment (and provide funding) - show me the money!
