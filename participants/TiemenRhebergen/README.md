### Note for participants

Create a new folder within this folder on your PC and rename it using your own name.
*Note that everyone will have their own folder so perhaps use your full name*

During the workshop, save all of your training activities within this folder.  Your workshop facilitators will be able to access your files and even contribute changes or "fixes" for you using GitHub.
You will be able to access these files after the workshop through GitHub or the files in your local repository.
